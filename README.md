# Hey there, i'm Override ðŸ‘‹

## A Passionate Young Developper

Started developpement on 2020, i began as a minecraft plugin developper for my minecraft server (which was a big flop!)  
Then, i made few libraries for the minecraft community, and decided to stop making plugins and go out of minecraft environment, in order to create more intrusting and useful projects.

### Technologies and languages i've used :
languages: 
- Java -> good level
- Scala -> intermediate, still need to use FP for real
- html/js/css -> learning/using for [The Linkit Wiki](github.com/Override-6/Linkit-Wiki) microsite
- Python -> beginner, only used for school projects but i already had the dev concepts comming from java/scala
- C++ -> beginner, only used for creating java native libraries for the Linkit Project
- C# -> only touched once for an unfinished web app project, but looked familiar!

technologies: 
- Gradle, Maven
- MySql, MySql Connector (JDBC)
- Jetbrains IDEs (IJ pro, WebStorm, CLion)
- Visual Studio
- Java Native Interface
- Android Studio
- git/github (of course)
- Github actions, CI/CD
- JUnit tests, Mockito
- JavaFX
- JProfiler, basic profiling
- The Linkit Framework (:p)
