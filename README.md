# Hey there, i'm Override ðŸ‘‹

## A Passionate 18yo Developper

Started developpement on 2020, i began as a minecraft plugin developper for my minecraft server (which had a big flop!)  
Then, i made few libraries for the minecraft community, and decided to stop plugin development and go out of the minecraft environment, in order to create more intrusting and useful projects. (such as Linkit, which is my first ambitious project !)

### Technologies and languages i've used :
languages: 
- Java -> good level
- Scala 2 -> intermediate, still need to use FP for real
- html/js/css -> learning/using for [The Linkit Wiki](github.com/Override-6/Linkit-Wiki) microsite
- Python -> beginner, only used for school projects but i already had the dev concepts comming from java/scala
- C++ -> beginner, only used for creating java native libraries for the Linkit Project
- C# -> only touched once for an unfinished web app project, but looked familiar!

technologies: 
- Gradle, Maven
- MySql, MySql Connector (JDBC)
- Jetbrains IDEs (IJ pro, WebStorm, CLion)
- Visual Studio
- Java Native Interface
- Android Studio
- git/github (of course)
- Github actions, CI/CD
- JUnit tests, Mockito
- JavaFX
- JProfiler, basic profiling
- Scala parser combinator
- The Linkit Framework (:p)

### ðŸ”­ Currently working on [The Linkit Project](https://override-6.github.io/Linkit/)
Linkit is a high level networking framework written in scala, learn more on the wiki.  
It'll may be never finished completely, but i like to add features, review some sides of the project, create third party projects (the wiki, the 'bhv' language, which is currently internal to the repository, but will soon get migrated in its own repository). The amount of work is tremendous, but i really enjoy to push my limits, to
think big, this project started on august 2020, and, even if it is not stable, i like to make it bigger, because it forces myself to introduce to new technologies, new things to develop etc...  
This project is overall a learning excuse.  

This project still very serious though, and i'm making my possible to make a good framework, and try to stabilize it as possible.
