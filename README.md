## A Passionate Developper

Started developpement in 2020, I began as a minecraft plugin developper for my minecraft server (which was a big flop!)  
Then, I made few libraries for the minecraft community, and decided to stop plugin development and go out of the minecraft environment, in order to create more intrusting and useful projects. (such as Linkit, which is my first ambitious project !)
