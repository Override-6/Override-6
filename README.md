## A Passionate Developper

Started developpement in 2020, I began as a minecraft plugin developper for my minecraft server (which was a big flop!)  
Then, I made few libraries for the minecraft community, and decided to stop plugin development and go out of the minecraft world, in order to create more intrusting and useful projects.

Look at the pinned projects for more :p
